# Changelog

## v0.3.5

- Previously, this library skipped transformations of functions due to the complexity of "inverting" a function mathematically; now, this library curries the original function forward (SEE THE UPDATED README FOR AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY)
- Updated README to reflect changes
- Refactored the original `evaluators` file into a directory with multiple files
- Refactored the library's internal definition of "invertObject" vs "handleObject"
- Minor updates to README
- Minor comment update to `types.ts` file

## v0.3.4

- Update packages

## v0.3.3

- Improve typings

## v0.3.2

- Update `invert`'s function definition to allow an argument of undefined
  - Note: It seems not to be intuitive to pass in an empty object for non-typescript projects, and, unfortunately, I've haven't found a solution for allowing undefineds for JS but not for TS
