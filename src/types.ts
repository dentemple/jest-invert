export type AnyJavascriptObject = Object[] | Array<any> | null

export type Config = {

// Short explanation: We utilize `any` here to support multiple versions of Jest.
// Long explanation: Jest utilizes the "Function-Object" nature of JS functions
//    when building the `expect` object, which means it's an invokable function
//    that also has object properties on it.  To TS type it, we could either
//    import `expect` from a specific version of Jest, or try to type both sides
//    of this object in a way that's compatible for all versions of the library.
//    So as not to risk unnecessarily breaking someone's environment with a
//    poorly chosen abstraction--for what's essentially a very minor benefit
//    overall--chosing to type `expect` as `any` seems good enough.
// If anyone knows of a better solution, feel free to post it to the Issues page.
